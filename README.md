# FRONTELUS

Frontelus was an academic web framework to build sites for fun and prototyping. However, Frontelus was not for stable deploys  neither for production purpose. This framework was built and written by me( Daniel Morales ) when I was on university. There is no engineering principles applied neither documentation. Comments in code are missing. This is a legacy and deprecated system. It was my beautiful creation few years ago.

But you can learn  how a basic web framework is coded by inspecting frontelus' source code.
